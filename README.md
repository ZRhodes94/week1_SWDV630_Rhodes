# week1

All code is in the associated python file. I will answer the additional questions here:

1 - 3. Answered in python file

4. Interfaces are the portion of OOP that the user directly interacts with. Whereas the Implementation is the data and function behind the scenes. The interfaces are limited amounts of interaction- only what the user absolutely needs. Implementation includes all of the remaining code that allways the program to function. The pieces that let the users data interact with or be stored somewhere safe and secure.

5. Based on the reading for this week, I acknowledge that the interface for a large data storage application only needs to include a limited amount of interactions for the user. The interface only needs to have the bare minimum of what a user could need. It is also perferred to limit repetition of code. For this particular app, I believe that the user needs to interact with the data and select a location to store that data. In general, an object can be created that that allows user interaction with data. Then, depending on the particular storage device implementation, there will need to be subclasses to take that data and store it on the selected device. For data storage and manipulation apps, the user only needs to be able to interact with and save the data. The particular methods of storing data and the interactions between the hardware and the software are not things that the user needs to access.
